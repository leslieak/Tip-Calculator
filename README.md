Tip-Calculator
==============

Prework Project for iOS for Designers

This is an iOS demo application for a tip calculator. User can enter a bill total and the calculator will calculate a percentage based on the total, add it to the bill total, and display the final total, which includes the tip. The tip percentage can be adjusted using segmented control (from 18%, 20% and 22%).

Time spent: 7 hours 

Notes: 

I had never worked with Xcode before, and found it to be pretty fun and intuitive. I had also never worked with Github before, so configuring and learning that added 1-1/2 hours to the time spent on the project.

I spent some time adjusting the layout, giving it a background, an icon and adding custom fonts.
